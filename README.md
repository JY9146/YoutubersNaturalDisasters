A faithful recreation of the Volcanoes and Sinkholes in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2SOKyNJ1jQ. If you have anything to add, make a pull request or a fork or whatever.

We are almost finished! All we have left are earthquakes and the volcano from this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h61SlPZfWfw
NEARLY FINISHED! We only have to perfect the Sinkhole and create the Volcano. Please don't clone it, the mod isn't finished yet! We will update the Readme when it is! If you want to help us make it (as we don't have much coding experience) DM JY9146 on Discord!

The project isn't dead, it is being worked on through MCreator and we have a lot if ideas for this mod, so it might take some time. We will try to keep you guys updated on how it's going.
When the mod is done, it will require the mods Photon and Weather Storms and Tornadoes (and their dependencies)
